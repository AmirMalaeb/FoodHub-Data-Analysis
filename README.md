# FoodHub Data Analysis

This project is a comprehensive data analysis of customer data from FoodHub, aimed at uncovering insights to improve business strategies and customer satisfaction. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Project Files
- `FoodHub_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook file with the full code, data analysis, and model training steps.

## Project Overview
### Objective
The primary objective is to analyze customer data from FoodHub to identify key insights that can help improve customer satisfaction, optimize marketing efforts, and enhance overall business strategies.

### Data
The dataset includes features related to customer behavior and demographics such as:
- **Customer Information**: Age, Gender, Location
- **Order Details**: Order history, Order frequency, Average order value
- **Engagement**: Interaction with promotions, Feedback ratings, Time spent on platform

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing data distributions and relationships
   - Identifying patterns and trends
   - Deriving meaningful insights

3. **Model Training**
   - Building predictive models to understand customer behavior
   - Training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Selecting the best model based on evaluation metrics

5. **Feature Importance Analysis**
   - Identifying the most important features contributing to customer behavior predictions
   - Understanding how each feature influences the model

## Results
- Successfully identified key customer segments and their characteristics.
- Provided actionable insights for targeted marketing and improving customer engagement.

### Key Findings
- **Frequent Customers**: Identified a segment of customers who frequently order and provide high ratings.
- **Promotion Sensitive**: Found a group of customers highly responsive to promotions and discounts.
- **High-Value Customers**: Recognized customers with high average order value and frequent orders.
